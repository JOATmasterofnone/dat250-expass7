## Technical Problems Encountered

- The installation tutorial was not written from the user's perspective; it reads more like a developer explaining the installation process as if the reader will perform maintenance on it. This made it less informative. I found a YouTube video with a better explanation.

## Pending Issues

- I didn't encounter any pending issues with this assignment. It was actually quite enjoyable. I even attempted to work on the routing and topics parts of the tutorial.
